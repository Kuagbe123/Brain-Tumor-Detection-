Automatically classifies brain tumor images into malignant and benign using Matlab
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain that either begins in the brain tissue
itself or spreads into the brain from elsewhere. Primary brain tumors are relatively rare,
accounting for 1.4% of all new cancer cases in the United States (Kimberly et al.,2021).
However, because of their proximity to essential brain structures, their effects can be devastating
as they directly affect cognitive, motor and sensory functions.
