# Brain-Tumor-Detection-
Automatically classifies brain tumor images into malignant and benign using Matlab
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain that either begins in the brain tissue
itself or spreads into the brain from elsewhere. Primary brain tumors are relatively rare,
accounting for 1.4% of all new cancer cases in the United States (Kimberly et al.,2021).
However, because of their proximity to essential brain structures, their effects can be devastating
as they directly affect cognitive, motor and sensory functions.

# Importance of Brain Tumor Detection
Brain tumors can significantly impair a person's physical, cognitive, and emotional health.
Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to minimize adverse consequences.
Brain tumor detection is an important aspect in the management and timely treatment of
brain-related diseases.
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain and can be either cancerous
(malignant) or noncancerous (benign). Early detection of brain tumors is critical to improving
patient outcomes and increasing the likelihood of successful treatment. Advances in medical
imaging technology and machine learning algorithms over the years have greatly improved the
accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection.

Sensitivity (Recall):
Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 0.88 / (0.88 + 0.12) = 0.88 / 1 = 0.88 or 88%
Specificity:
Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 0.92 / (0.92 + 0.08) = 0.92 / 1 = 0.92 or 92%
Accuracy:
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) = (0.88 + 0.92) / (0.88 + 0.92 + 0.08 + 0.12) =
1.80 / 2 = 0.90 or 90%
So, the calculated values are as follows:
Sensitivity: 88%
Specificity: 92%
Accuracy: 90%
● SVM Classification Results:
Accuracy: 90%
Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): 88%
Specificity (True Negative Rate): 92%
● Morphology-based Segmentation Results:
Dice Coefficient: 0.87
Jaccard Index: 0.82
